Description: Performs exploratory data analysis and variable screening for
    binary classification models using weight-of-evidence (WOE) and information
    value (IV). In order to make the package as efficient as possible, aggregations
    are done in data.table and creation of WOE vectors can be distributed across
    multiple cores. The package also supports exploration for uplift models (NWOE
    and NIV).
